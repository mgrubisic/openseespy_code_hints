# openseespy_code_hints
code hints for OpenSeesPy

This file is mainly used for OpenSeesPy's code hints. 
Download ``openseespy.pyi`` file, and place it in the same folder as ``opensees.pyd`` or ``opensees.so`` (in your OpenSeesPy installation). 

That's ok. You can get ``openseespy`` code hints in ``visual studio code`` (or other IDE...) now.
